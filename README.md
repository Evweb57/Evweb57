  Unsolved problems:
  How to add functionality to links, letting them click though to the other tab tabs.
  Deployment issue, assuming load order of links. Not displaying across the screen as intended.

  Notes for the future:
  Pick a better API, having a direct limit on the number of calls you can make is incredibly limiting on the work that can be accomplished in a single day.
